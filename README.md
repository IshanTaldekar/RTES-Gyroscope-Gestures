# RTES-Gyroscope-Gestures
This project involved writing code to use the gyroscope onboard the STM32F429I-Discovery board to record gestures as well as unlock profiles by repeating the recorded gestures. The onboard touch LCD was used to provide an UI to make choosing between multiple user profiles possible.
